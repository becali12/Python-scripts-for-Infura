# Python-scripts-for-Infura

This repository contains scripts I've created for the Support Tips category on the Infura community. 

**watch.py** - continuosly searches the latest block for ETH transactions incoming to a specified address.
**watch_subscribe.py** - uses websockets to subscribe to the pending transactions pool, then looks for ETH transactions incoming to a specified address.
**watch_filter.py** - attempt to do the same as above using filters, not working due to an Infura limitation
